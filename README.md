## Homework 1
**Topic:** Write a program implementing the perceptron learning algorithm.

The task at hand is to implement the perceptron learning algorithm to classify whether an animal is a cat or a dog based on its size and weight.\
Numerical features are used as inputs for classification.\
The program is designed to train the perceptron model on a given dataset of animals with their corresponding labels and then make predictions on new test inputs. 

## Homework 3
**Topic:** Write a program implementing feature normalization. Find and demonstrate a real-world example.

I use Python randomly make a dataset for  20 students' CGPA and their Salary, and then normalize it

| CGPA | Salary |
|------|--------|
| 3.14 | 65126  |
| 1.73 | 45567  |
| 2.10 | 71234  |
| 2.59 | 36487  |
| 3.70 | 50211  |

## Homework 4
**Topic:** Write a program implementing the linear regression algorithm solving a freely chosen problem.\
I using a small simple Predicting Sales Revenue dataset for this problem (d4.csv)

| Advertising Spend (Online Ads) | Advertising Spend (Social Media) | Advertising Spend (Email Marketing) | Sales Revenue |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------|
| 1000                          | 500                              | 200                                | 2500          |

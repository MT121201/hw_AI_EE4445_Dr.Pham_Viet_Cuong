## Homework 1
**Topic:** Write a program implementing the perceptron learning algorithm\
*Solution :* \
The task at hand is to implement the perceptron learning algorithm to classify whether an animal is a cat or a dog based on its size and weight.\
Numerical features are used as inputs for classification.\
The program is designed to train the perceptron model on a given dataset of animals with their corresponding labels and then make predictions on new test inputs. 

## Homework 2
**Topic:** Write a program implementing feature normalization. Find and demonstrate a real-world example.\
*Solution :*\
I use Python randomly make a dataset for  20 students CGPA and their Salary, and then normalize it\

| CGPA | Salary |
|------|--------|
| 3.14 | 65126  |
| 1.73 | 45567  |
| 2.10 | 71234  |
| 2.59 | 36487  |

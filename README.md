# Homework 1
**Topic:** Write a program implementing the perceptron learning algorithm\
*Problem:* \
The task at hand is to implement the perceptron learning algorithm to classify whether an animal is a cat or a dog based on its size and weight.\
Numerical features are used as inputs for classification.\
The program is designed to train the perceptron model on a given dataset of animals with their corresponding labels and then make predictions on new test inputs.
